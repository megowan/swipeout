How to make a skin
------------------
Tilemap Tileset needs three layers. shadow, floor, and walls. z indexes are 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The background will be layer 0
For the walls, setup custom metadata of "wall_data" of value type string. strings are the letters "udlr" corresponding to which wall segments are part of the sprite
Order is important
Remove unused tiles from the tilemap. I name the atlases "FloorShadows", "Walls" and "Floors" and their IDs are 0, 1, and 2.
For the "Walls" tileset, also set the texture offset to (20,20) on all of the tiles. That will nudge the tiles into the top-left corner of the tile, to sit on top of the intersection
For the floor tiles, set the offset to (-12,-12) and edit the modulation color to have an alpha of 100

Remember when making a new character
------------------------------------
* Object needs to be pickable
* hook up animationtree signal
* hook up input signal

Escape
------
* When an inhabitant enters a cell, if there's a prop, tell the prop that it got touched by the new inhabitant
* goal gets touched_by(inhabitant)
* if the goal is inactive, do nothing
* inhabitant gets touched_prop(prop)
inhabitant moving state has a reference to the escape state
[ ] Don't even go to BUMP or keep moving. touches only happen during MOVING

Board MVC
---------
BoardModel is the string representation
BoardController requests a boardmodel from the boardcollection by index
BoardController builds a board
  instantiates a board tuple
	attaches the boardModel
	instantiates the theme from the resource
	instantiates the gameboard (logical)
	attaches the visual (theme) as a  child to the controller
  Reads through the ascii art of the layout
  Builds up the walls, floors, props and inhabitants on the visual and logical
 
BoardTuple holds the BoardModel, the GameBoard, and the BoardView

Collisions
----------
Checking the next cell while moving
  if it's not empty, get the inhabitant
  tell the inhabitant that they were hitby(self, dir)
  switch to bump

Inhabitants had a HitBy(inhabitant, direction)
  Enemyl had to be in 'after' or in the bump state
  If sparky hit enemy, then you triggered your zap death and sparky's shockdeath
  If the thing that bumped the enemy was ball, then trigger ball's bumpdeath

Ball's hitby
  looked at the type. If it was ball, neutral, hroller, vroller, then do nothing
  If it was bomb, then zapdeath
  Otherwise, switch to bumpdeath

Ball had a bumpdeath state

zapdeath
  everyone has a spark sprite, set to sparks_idle
  When sparky kills you, the sprite is made visible and plays
  Bomb makes the sound.
